## Introduction

In this project, you will create a fan website that lets a user make choices that change the content of the webpage! You could make a webpage with content about different sports teams, fashion brands, TV shows, or anything else you and your friends are fans of!

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Bonding over <span style="color: #0faeb0">**shared interests**</span> is what the internet was built for! From the earliest message boards to modern sites like Reddit, people love to read about and discuss their favourite hobbies and forms of entertainment!
</p>

You will:

- Choose three options for colours and content
- Use buttons, CSS, and JavaScript to change the whole webpage
- Use local storage to make the choice permanent
