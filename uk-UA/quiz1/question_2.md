In CSS, you can create very specific selectors. If you have an element with an ID attribute `slot-1` and a class `trex`, which of these selectors would you use to style **only** the element with **both** of those attributes?

\--- choices ---

- ( ) `.slot-1#trex`

  \--- feedback ---

  In this example, the selectors are the wrong way around. `slot-1` is a class and `trex` is an ID.

  \--- /feedback ---

- ( ) `#slot-1, .trex`

  \--- feedback ---

  This selector would style elements with **either** the ID or the class you want.

  \--- /feedback ---

- (x) `#slot-1.trex`

  Молодець! This is correct!
