## legend: Question 1 of 3

When creating new variables to store colours and fonts, your CSS might look like this...

## --- code ---

language: css
filename: default.css
line_numbers: false
--------------------------------------------------------

:root {
/\* Font variable \*/
\--main-font: 'sans-serif';

/\* Base Colours \*/
\--body-background: #FFFFFF;
\--body-text-colour: #000000;
\--nav-bar: #FFFFFF;
}

\--- /code ---

Which of these would allow you to **use** the `--body-background` variable in another CSS selector?

\--- choices ---

- ( ) `background-color: --body-background;` ()

  \--- feedback ---

  You need to tell CSS that you are using a variable.

  \--- /feedback ---

- (x) `background-color: var(--body-background);`

  \--- feedback ---

  Correct!

  \--- /feedback ---

- ( ) `background-color: root(--body-background);`

  \--- feedback ---

  The `:root` selector is used to create variables for your whole webpage, but when you use them you need to use another keyword.
