In CSS you can create very specific selectors, if you have an element with an id attribute `slot-2` and a class `trex`, which of these selectors would you use to style **only** the element with **both** of those attributes?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `.slot-1#trex`

  --- feedback ---

  In this example the selectos are the wrong way around, `slot-1` is a class and `trex` is an id.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `#slot-1, .trex`

  --- feedback ---

  This selector would style elements with **either** the id or the class you want.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) `#slot-1.trex`

  --- feedback ---

  Well done! This is correct!
